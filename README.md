# Browser console script to automate the search for new offers and send request message
this script runs in browser console, gets the new offers of the site, sends a message for the new offers automatically, and saves the offer IDs, not to send a request twice

### The site I wrote this code for has an offer-turnover of approx. 10 minutes, and a push notification system that sends the notifications in about 15-20 minutes.
### I work 10 hours a day and I can not check the new offers by refreshing the page in every 60 seconds, so I did not have a chance to send a request.
### I find it as a discrimination against the workers.
